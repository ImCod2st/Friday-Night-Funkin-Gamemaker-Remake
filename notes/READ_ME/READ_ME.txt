// PLEASE READ \\

Not all the code in this project has been commented correctly.
And there may be some weird formatting / names here and there.

If u wanna make mods or whatever using this then go ahead.
Always make sure to credit the original creators of this game tho, they deserve all the support.

// IMPORTANT \\
When working with charts in the IDE, you MUST put the songs folder in in the APPDATA folder for the game.
Otherwise it will not work.
