The **Friday Night Funkin: Gamemaker Remake** *(FNF: GMS2 Remake)* for short, is a remake of the game titled **Friday Night Funkin** by ninja_muffin99 & friends on itch.io.
If you have not played the original game, *please* play it [here](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin).

This project is a passion project, and **I will not profit** from this remakes creation.

You can find the games download link [here](https://github.com/ImCodist/Friday-Night-Funkin-Gamemaker-Remake/releases).

## Motivation
I made this out of **love for the original game** and to **improve** my skill in new areas of Gamemaker Studio. As a result I have learned how to work with *higher-res graphics*, and how to make a *ddr style rhythm game work*.
